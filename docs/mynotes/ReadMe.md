# My Notes - A Journal of Discovery

[![Scuba](./images/stick_figure_scuba.gif)](#credits)

Your first learning adventure should begin with [**Mastering Markdown**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Learning how to use Markdown now will really help you focus on capturing **content** in this journal. :sunglasses:

## Web Project Setup

We do one-time set-up of our web project. That involves running these commands in the terminal:

```ps
pnpm init
pnpm add -D vite
```

Then, we edit the `package.json` file to change or add a script to run the developer server:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite"
  }
```

### Provided `package.json`

You can run `pnpm install` in the terminal to load up the 3rd-party libraries mentioned in the `package.json`.

## Table of Contents

> *Create an un-ordered list here for your own table of contents, and add links to additional Markdown pages in this folder.*
