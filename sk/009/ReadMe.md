### Falsey or Falsy

> The correct term is **"falsy"**, which refers to values that evaluate to false in boolean contexts. In programming, particularly in languages like JavaScript, falsy values include null, empty strings, and zero, which are not considered true in Boolean evaluation. The term "falsey" is also used but is less common and may sound made up to some people.
