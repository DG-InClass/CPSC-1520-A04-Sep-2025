# Project Demo

Here are the things I think you should know how to do:

- Emphasize semantic HTML
- Use Tailwind CSS in your site
- Write unit tests (e.g.: with `vitest`) - e.g.:
    - should correct image src
    - should correct hyperlink href


- [ ] Use Tailwind CSS with Vite
- [ ] Use Tailwind's `@apply` rule for semantic HTML
- [ ] Load Markdown files and render on page
  - [ ] Correct all the paths for image tags by matching to the `content/docs/images/index.json`.
  - [ ] Correct all links to other markdown files by matching against the `content/docs/index.json`
