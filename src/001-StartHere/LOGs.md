## Version Control & Markdown Intro

*At the end of this lesson, you should be able to...*

- [ ] Describe what is meant by "version control"
  - Version control is a system that you can use to save "snapshots" of your software development work. It produces a history of the changes to your code (and documentation). It also makes it easier to collaborate in a team.
- [ ] Identify the version control system used in this course
  - We are using the **git** DVCS (distributed version control system).
- [ ] List the three primary states of a file in Git
  - Untracked - not yet saved in the git history
  - Modified - has changes, but is not yet "staged" for commit
  - Staged - has changes, and has been identified as ready to commit
- [ ] List seven of the most common Git commands
  - `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Some message"`, `git pull`, `git push`, `git log`, `git merge`
- [ ] Configure Git to use your name and email address
  - *See the notes on Dan's site for this course*
- [ ] Explain the purpose of the `.gitignore` file
  - Identifies the folders/files to **not** track in version control
- [ ] Create and synchronize commits as a means of submitting your work
  - *This is a skill to practice*
- [ ] Describe the purpose and basic principles of Markdown syntax
  - Markdown is a way to focus on the **content** rather than the *presentation* of information.
- [x] Create notes written in Markdown format
  - Practice, practice, practice.
- [ ] List four common commands used in the terminal
  - `cd`, `mkdir`, `cls`, and others (again, on *dan's site*)
- [ ] Identify the keyboard shortcuts for opening the terminal inside and outside of VS Code
  - `ctrl` + `\`` (backtick) to toggle the terminal window inside of VS Code
  - `ctrl` + `shift` + `c` to open an external terminal window
- [ ] Identify the keyboard shortcut to open the command palette in VS Code
  - `F1` key or `ctrl` + `shift` + `p`
- [ ] Perform basic tasks in the terminal related to navigation and version control
  - Practice, practice, practice.
